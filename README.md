Active Staking Rewards, inspired by [vote.jup.ag](https://vote.jup.ag/).

## Introduction

This program is based on my previous hackathon winning [dao](https://github.com/mael-bomane/dao) program, refactored to lift 10mb account size limit (previously a monolith of votes & deposits), and add rewards shared proportionally among voters claimable on regular schedule.
